# WoZ

This is a GUI that we developed to improve the way we control the iCub during HRI experiments. 
It is flexible enough to be used for other purposes, like demos, tests. 
Of course it can be improved, it was designed for iCub-specialists as an interface to our modules.
It is based on GTK.

The GUI communicates via yarp ports to a number of modules: actionsServer2, taskPlayer, iSpeak2...

The GUI was developed by me and my student Charles Ballarini, in the context of the EDHHI project.
